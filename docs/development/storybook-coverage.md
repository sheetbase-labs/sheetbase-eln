# Storybook coverage

This file records the deliberate exceptions to the rule that every exported
React component has a story. It is the input the structural guard reads: a
component that has neither a story nor an entry here is a coverage gap.

Stories live in `src/stories/<ComponentName>.stories.tsx` (a few live beside
their component under `src/components/**`); the Storybook config picks up both.
No story in this repository reaches a database or the network: fixture data is
static, and reads are satisfied by seeding a React Query cache with
`staleTime: Infinity` or by a promise that never settles, which renders the
component's own loading or error state.

| Component                         | Reason                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ScientificWorkbookProvider`      | Provider only. It creates the workbook context its children read (`useSheetCalculation`); it renders `children` unchanged and has no rendered surface of its own. |
| `useAutosave` (`use-autosave.ts`) | Hook, not a component. Exported so callers can hold the machine directly; it has no rendered surface.                                                             |

| Component                                          | Reason                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ReferencePicker` (`formula-reference-editor.tsx`) | Class, not a component. It is the keyboard reference-picking controller the in-cell editor instantiates; it returns no JSX. |
| `CONFLICT_REASON_MAX`, `REFERENCE_COLORS`          | Constants, not components.                                                                                                  |

## Review

| Component                                 | Reason                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `AREA_LABELS`, `KIND_META`-derived labels | Constants, not components.         |
| `exactText`, `focusChange`                | Utility functions, not components. |

## Collaboration

| Component               | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CollaborationProvider` | Provider. It renders `children` unchanged when collaboration is disabled and otherwise mounts the Liveblocks provider; the disabled branch is covered by its story, the enabled branch needs a Liveblocks secret. |

Components whose populated states need a connected Liveblocks room
(`PresenceStack`, `RemoteSelectionChips`, `BlockCoEditBadge`, `ThreadPanel`,
`CollaborationRoom`) do have stories, but a storybook build has no websocket
and no token endpoint, so those stories cover the reachable contract: nothing
renders before the room is ready, and nothing throws outside a room boundary.
The populated states are exercised by the component tests with the room hooks
mocked at the module boundary.

| `CHART_PALETTE` (`chart-renderer.tsx`)          | Constant re-export, not a component. |

| `mapTimelineEvents`, `describeAuditEvent`, `auditLinkFor` | Utility functions, not components. |

## Scientific

None. Every exported component has a story.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `loadCodeDecoder`, `setFallbackDecoderLoader`, `createJsQrDecoder` | Decoder loaders and factories, not components. |

## Import

None. Both exported flows have stories. The upload flow's later steps need a
stored file; the map and check steps are covered from static fixtures of the
stored-file read.

## Related work

None. Both the pure list and the live panel have stories.

## Covered elsewhere (not a gap, not a skip)

These exported components have a story, but under a file name that does not
match the component: the story was written before this area's per-component
naming and is kept where it is.

| Component                                                         | Story file                                                                                                                    |

| `CommentThread` (`comments/comment-thread.tsx`)                   | `src/stories/CommentThread.stories.tsx` (moved out of `CommentPanel.stories.tsx`, which now covers the panel it is named for) |

## Re-export aliases

| Export                                                                 | Reason                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RecordHeaderAvatar`, `RecordHeaderBadge` (`record/record-header.tsx`) | Re-exports of `Avatar` and `Badge`; covered by `Avatar.stories.tsx` and `Badge.stories.tsx`.                                    |
| `ComposedSheetWorkspace` (`sheet/composed-sheet-workspace.tsx`)        | Re-export of the workspace in `canonical-sheet-workspace.tsx`; one component, one story (`ComposedSheetWorkspace.stories.tsx`). |
